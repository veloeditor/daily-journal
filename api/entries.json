The other trick was figuring out how to have our checkboxes checked based on the boolean value that was pulled from the API. We created a function with an if/else statement that checked for true and then inserted that function in to the html component.",

The subject is pretty complicated but I think I can get a grasp on it soon enough. I wouldn't say I ended the day happy, sort of in between...",
